-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Speaker static at startup due to JIT compilation
	possibly vary or increase the buffer size
Speaker ticks audibly when simulated drum pressure is released
	should be modified to only tick when pressure is first applied
Does not successfully pass IIe memory test
Needs to reset keyboard when focus is regained to avoid stuck-keys
Need to swap memory bus outputs from video to keyboard out for 16 read types
